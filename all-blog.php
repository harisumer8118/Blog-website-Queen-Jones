        <h3>If you're stranded on an island, a 'HELP' sign can actually
          save you â€” but there's an even better way to get rescued</h3>
          <p>Two of three men stranded on the uninhabited island of Pikelot Atoll in Micronesia wave life jackets as<br>
            a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft discovers them.
             Three men stranded on a Pacific island were rescued after creating a "HELP" sign with palm leaves.
            A survival expert said lighting three fires is an effective way to send a distress signal.
            She also praised the men and said the key thing is to be creative and find any way to send a signal.
